featuring all major language constructs.

Variables declaration, these are mutable values. may or may not be initialized at declaration, and start with an underscore
The data type is separated by a % symbol
The data type can be a primitive type, a collection, or an array of primitive types or collections
The data type can be followed by a default value, which is optional
The assignment operator is a colon
##

_name%string:"Hello, World!";

# Define a collection
# collections are defined using the col keyword followed by the collection name and members in curly braces
# collection members are separated by commas, and must contain data type. these can be variables, constants or arrays of variables or constants
# collection memebers can be of any data type, including primitive types, collections, and arrays
# collection members cannot have initializers
col Student {
    _name%string,
    _age%int,
    _grades%float[]
};

# Constants declaration, these are immutable values. must be initialized at declaration, and start with two underscores
__PI%float:3.14159;
__MAX_STUDENTS%int:100;

# Function
# Functions are defined using the shap keyword followed by the function name and parameters in parentheses
# The return type is specified after the closing parenthesis seperated by a > symbol, followed by the function body in curly braces
# The ret statement is used to return a value from the function
# The function body can contain variable and constant declarations, assignments, conditional statements, loops, and function calls
# The function body can also contain mathematical and bitwise operations

        _count:_count + 1;
    }
    
    ret _sum / _count;
}

# Function and case
# The case statement is used to define a switch-case statement
# The case statement is followed by an expression in square brackets
# The case statement can have multiple cases, each followed by a colon
# The case statement can have a default case, which is an empty square brackets
# The case statement can have a default case, which is an empty square brackets
# The case statement can have a break statement to exit the case block
# The case statement can have a continue statement to skip the rest of the current iteration
